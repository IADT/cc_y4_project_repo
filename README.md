# cc_y4_project_repo
This is a stub starter repo for your creative computing project

You will be using Github to manage your software this year. I have set up this repo to get you started. 

Clone this repository and use it to archive your work in progress.

Your documentation and slide decks should be added to the Docs folder as .pdf files.
